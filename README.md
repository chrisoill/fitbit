# FitBit Tracker Data
Any code for my cleaning and analyses of the <b>FitBit Tracker Data Set</b> goes into this repository. 

### FitBit Data Cleaning Files

I've included three files in this repository, all created using <b>RStudio</b>.\
The <b>.rmd</b> file is the code for the <b>.html</b> file.\
The <b>.r</b> file is just the <b>R</b> code for the <b>.rmd</b> file.
